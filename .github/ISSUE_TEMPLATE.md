Before submitting your issue, make sure:

- [ ] You're using a [stable release](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266/releases), not the Git development version which is, by definition, unstable
- [ ] You've read the documentation for *your* release, which is in the `docs/` folder of the `.zip` of the release you're using, especially the **Getting started** and **Troubleshooting** pages, which contain respectively the minimum required version of the dependencies, and some answsers to the most common problems

Thanks!
