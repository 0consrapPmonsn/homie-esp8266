# OTA

Homie for ESP8266 supports OTA, if enabled in the configuration, and if a compatible OTA entity is set up.

It works this way:

1. The entity responsible for OTA checks the device `$fwversion` property. If it detects there is a newer version available and `$ota/enabled` is `true`, it sends the payload to the device `$ota/payload` as a retained message.
2. The entity responsible for OTA sends a non-retained notification to the device `$ota`, with the newer version as the content.
3. The device then subscribes to `$ota/payload`, actually flashing the new firmware.
4. Once done, the device reboots as soon as the device is resettable (with `Homie.setResettable()`).
5. The entity responsible for OTA, receiving the newer `$fwversion`, can optionally clean the payload sent to `$ota/payload`.

### homie-ota

* [homie-ota](https://github.com/jpmens/homie-ota) is written in Python. It provides an OTA server for Homie devices as well as a simple _inventory_ which can be useful to keep track of Homie devices. [homie-ota](https://github.com/jpmens/homie-ota) also enables you to trigger an OTA update (over MQTT, using the Homie convention) from within its inventory. New firmware can be uploaded to `homie-ota` which detects firmware name (`fwname`) and version (`fwversion`) from the uploaded binary blob, thanks to an idea and code contributed by Marvin.
