# Limitations and known issues

In `configuration` and `normal` modes, Homie for ESP8266 code is designed to be non-blocking, so that you can do other tasks in the main `loop()`. However, the connection to the MQTT broker is blocking during ~5 seconds in case the server is unreachable. This is an Arduino for ESP8266 limitation, and we can't do anything on our side to solve this issue, not even a timeout.

The `OTA` mode is blocking for obvious reason.
