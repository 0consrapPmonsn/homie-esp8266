# Limitations and known issues

## Blocking Homie code

In `configuration` and `normal` modes, Homie for ESP8266 code is designed to be non-blocking, so that you can do other tasks in the main `loop()`. However, the connection to the MQTT broker is blocking during ~5 seconds in case the server is unreachable. This is an Arduino for ESP8266 limitation, and we can't do anything on our side to solve this issue, not even a timeout.

## SSL support

In Homie for ESP8266 v1.x, SSL was possible but it was not reliable. Due to the asynchronous nature of the v2.x, SSL is not available anymore.

## ADC readings

[This is a known esp8266/Arduino issue](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/1634) that polling `analogRead()` too frequently forces the Wi-Fi to disconnect. As a workaround, don't poll the ADC more than one time every 3ms.
