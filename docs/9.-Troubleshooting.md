# Troubleshooting

## 1. I see some garbage on the Serial monitor?

You are probably using a generic ESP8266. The problem with these modules is the built-in LED is tied to the serial line. You can do two things:

1. Disable the serial logging, to have the LED working:
```c++
Homie.enableLogging(false); // before Homie.setup();
```
2. Disable the the LED blinking, to have the serial line working:
```c++
Homie.enableBuiltInLedIndicator(false); // before Homie.setup();
```

## 2. I see an `abort` message on the Serial monitor?

`abort()` is called by Homie for ESP8266 when the framework is used in a bad way. The possible causes are:

* You are calling a function that is meant to be called before `Homie.setup()`, after `Homie.setup()`

* One of the string you've used (in `setFirmware()`, `subscribe()`, etc.) is too long. Check the `Limits.hpp` file to see the max length possible for each string.
