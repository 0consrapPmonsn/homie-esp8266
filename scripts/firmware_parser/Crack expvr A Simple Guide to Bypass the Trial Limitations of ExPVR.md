## How to use ExPVR
 
Using ExPVR is simple and straightforward. All you need is a PC with Windows 7 or later, a USB to SATA adapter or enclosure, and the hard disks from your Sky boxes. You can also use an external hard disk as a temporary storage if you want to copy recordings between two Sky boxes.
 
First, you need to download and install ExPVR from [http://www.ph-mb.com/products/expvr/downloads](http://www.ph-mb.com/products/expvr/downloads). You can use the trial version for 14 days, or purchase a license for Â£14.99.
 
Next, you need to connect the hard disk from your source Sky box to your PC using the USB to SATA adapter or enclosure. You can also connect the hard disk from your destination Sky box if you want to copy recordings directly.
 
Then, you need to run ExPVR and select the source and destination disks or devices. You can choose to copy all recordings, or select specific ones. You can also filter the recordings by genre, channel, date, etc.
 
Finally, you need to click on the "Copy" button and wait for the process to finish. ExPVR will copy your recordings and convert them to the appropriate format if needed. It will also copy your scheduled recordings and series links if you want.
 
Once the process is done, you can disconnect the hard disks and put them back in your Sky boxes. You can also watch the extracted recordings on your PC or portable device using any video playing software that supports TS files.
