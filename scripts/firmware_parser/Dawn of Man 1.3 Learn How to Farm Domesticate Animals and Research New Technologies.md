# Dawn of Man 1.3: The Farming Update
 
Dawn of Man, the popular survival and city-building game set in the Stone Age, has just released its latest update, version 1.3. The update introduces a major new feature: farming.
 
Farming allows players to grow crops such as wheat, barley, flax, and lentils, as well as domesticating animals such as sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle. Farming provides a reliable source of food and resources for the settlement, but also requires more management and planning. Players will have to deal with crop rotation, soil fertility, irrigation, pests, diseases, and seasons.

The update also adds new buildings, technologies, and challenges related to farming. For example, players can build granaries to store their harvests, mills to process grains into flour, bakeries to make bread, looms to weave cloth from flax or wool, and stables to house their livestock. New technologies include pottery, metallurgy, plows, sickles, scythes, and cheese making. New challenges include defending the crops from raiders and wild animals, coping with droughts and floods, and trading surplus goods with other settlements.
 
Dawn of Man 1.3 is available now for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux on Steam and GOG.com. The update is free for existing owners of the game. For more information, visit the official website or follow the developers on Twitter and Facebook.

If you are looking for some tips and tricks to play Dawn of Man, here are some useful ones:
 
- Pay attention to the needs and morale of your people. They need food, water, clothing, shelter, health, and happiness to survive and thrive. You can check their status by clicking on them or using the population panel.
- Balance your population growth with your resource production. Having more people means more mouths to feed, but also more workers and fighters. You can control your birth rate by setting the limit of huts in your settlement.
- Plan ahead for the seasons and the ages. Different seasons have different effects on your crops, animals, and resources. Different ages unlock new technologies, buildings, and challenges. You can see the current season and age in the top left corner of the screen.
- Explore the map and scout for resources and threats. You can use hunters, gatherers, or scouts to explore the map and find new sources of food, materials, or trade goods. You can also encounter wild animals, raiders, or friendly traders along the way.
- Save your game often and use different slots. The game can be unpredictable and challenging at times, so it's always good to have a backup plan in case something goes wrong. You can save your game manually or use the autosave feature.

We hope you enjoy playing Dawn of Man 1.3 and discover the wonders and dangers of the ancient world. If you have any feedback or suggestions for the game, feel free to contact the developers or join the community on Steam, Discord, Reddit, or YouTube.
