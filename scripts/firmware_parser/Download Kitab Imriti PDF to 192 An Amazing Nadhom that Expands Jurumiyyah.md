# Kitab Imriti: A Classic Work on Arabic Grammar
 
Kitab Imriti is a famous book of Arabic grammar written by Sheikh Yahya al-Imrithi, a renowned scholar of the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence. The book consists of 254 verses that cover the basic rules of Arabic syntax and morphology. It is considered one of the most important and popular works on Arabic grammar among students of Islamic sciences, especially in the traditional Islamic schools (pesantren) of Indonesia and Malaysia.
 
The book is also known as Nadhom Imriti, which means "the poetic version of Imriti", because it is composed in a rhymed prose style that makes it easy to memorize and recite. The book is based on an earlier work by Imam Shonhaji, called Matan Jurumiyyah, which is also a concise summary of Arabic grammar. However, Kitab Imriti expands and explains some of the topics that are briefly mentioned in Matan Jurumiyyah, such as the types of sentences, the types of verbs, the types of nouns, and the types of particles.

Kitab Imriti is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn Arabic grammar in a simple and elegant way. It is also a testament to the legacy of Sheikh Yahya al-Imrithi, who dedicated his life to spreading knowledge and goodness among his fellow Muslims.
  
One of the reasons why Kitab Imriti is so popular and widely used is because it follows a logical and systematic approach to teaching Arabic grammar. The book starts with the definition of kalam (speech), which is the subject matter of grammar, and then proceeds to explain the three main components of kalam: isim (noun), fi'l (verb), and harf (particle). The book then discusses the various categories and subcategories of each component, such as the types of nouns (singular, plural, masculine, feminine, etc.), the types of verbs (past, present, imperative, etc.), and the types of particles (prepositions, conjunctions, interjections, etc.). The book also covers the rules of i'rab (grammatical analysis), which is the process of identifying the grammatical functions and endings of words in a sentence.
 
Another reason why Kitab Imriti is so admired and respected is because it reflects the mastery and eloquence of Sheikh Yahya al-Imrithi in the Arabic language. The book is written in a clear and concise style that avoids ambiguity and confusion. The book also uses beautiful and poetic expressions that enhance the beauty and elegance of the language. For example, the book begins with a praise of Allah and a prayer for His guidance and assistance in learning grammar. The book also ends with a humble acknowledgment of the author's limitations and a request for forgiveness from Allah and the readers for any mistakes or shortcomings in the book.
 
Kitab Imriti is not only a book of grammar, but also a book of wisdom and spirituality. It teaches us how to appreciate and respect the language of the Quran and the Sunnah, which are the primary sources of Islamic guidance and legislation. It also teaches us how to use the language correctly and effectively to communicate our thoughts and feelings in a manner that pleases Allah and benefits others. Kitab Imriti is a treasure that every Muslim should cherish and benefit from.
