Fast And Furious 8 is not only a thrilling action movie, but also a touching tribute to the late Paul Walker, who played Brian O'Conner in the previous films. He died in a car accident in 2013, before the release of Furious 7. The movie honors his memory by showing his character's happy life with his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) and their son.
 
The movie also explores the theme of family and loyalty, which has been a core element of the franchise. Dom's betrayal shocks and hurts his friends, who consider him their brother. They struggle to understand his motives and to forgive him. They also face their own conflicts and doubts, such as Hobbs' relationship with his daughter and Shaw's past with Cipher.
 
Despite the serious tone, the movie does not lose its sense of humor and fun. It has many hilarious moments, such as Roman's (Tyrese Gibson) antics, Tej's (Ludacris) gadgets, and Hobbs and Shaw's banter. It also has some heartwarming scenes, such as Dom's reunion with his long-lost son and his family's barbecue at the end.

Fast And Furious 8 is also a showcase of the franchise's evolution and diversity. It started as a simple story of street racing and undercover cops in 2001, and has grown into a global phenomenon that spans multiple genres and cultures. It features characters from different backgrounds and ethnicities, who work together as a family.
 
The movie also pays homage to the previous films, by referencing some of their iconic scenes and lines. For example, Dom says "I don't have friends, I have family" in a flashback to Furious 7, and Hobbs says "Daddy's gotta go to work" before breaking out of his prison cell, echoing his line from Furious 7. The movie also features some familiar faces from the past, such as Elena (Elsa Pataky), Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), and Owen Shaw (Luke Evans).
 
Fast And Furious 8 is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, make you laugh, and touch your heart. It is a perfect example of how to make a successful sequel that stays true to its roots and delivers something new and exciting. It is a movie that you will want to watch again and again.
