The film is based on the novel of the same name by Chetan Bhagat, who is known for his bestselling books that cater to the masses. However, Half Girlfriend is not one of his best works, as it lacks depth, originality and logic. The novel has been adapted by Mohit Suri, who is known for his romantic thrillers like Aashiqui 2 and Ek Villain. However, Half Girlfriend is neither thrilling nor romantic enough to keep the viewers hooked.
 
The film tries to explore the complexities of love, friendship and social class in modern India, but fails to do so convincingly. The film also tries to touch upon issues like domestic violence, suicide and philanthropy, but does so superficially and without much impact. The film relies heavily on Raju Singh's swooning soundtrack to suggest emotional depth, but the songs are mostly forgettable and repetitive.
 
Half Girlfriend is a film that might appeal to fans of Chetan Bhagat's novels or the two leads, but for others it might be a tedious and disappointing watch. It is a film that does not live up to its potential and leaves you feeling half-satisfied.
