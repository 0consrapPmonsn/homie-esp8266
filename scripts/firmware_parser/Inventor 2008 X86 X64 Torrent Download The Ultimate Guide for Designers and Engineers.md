Fortunately, there is a way to download and install Inventor 2008 x86 x64 for free using a torrent client. A torrent client is a software that enables you to download files from other users who have the same file on their computers. This way, you can bypass the official download servers and get the software faster and easier. However, you should be aware that downloading and using Inventor 2008 without a license may be illegal in your country, so proceed at your own risk.
 
Here are the steps to download and install Inventor 2008 x86 x64 for free using a torrent client:
 
1. Download and install a torrent client of your choice. Some popular options are uTorrent, BitTorrent, qBittorrent, and Vuze.
2. Go to a torrent search engine such as The Pirate Bay, RARBG, 1337x, or Torrentz2 and search for "Inventor 2008 x86 x64". You should see several results with different file sizes and seeders. Seeders are the number of users who have the complete file and are sharing it with others. Choose the result with the highest number of seeders and the smallest file size.
3. Click on the download link or the magnet icon to open the torrent file in your torrent client. You may need to confirm or allow the action in your browser or antivirus software.
4. Select the destination folder where you want to save the downloaded file and start the download. Depending on your internet speed and the number of seeders, the download may take from a few minutes to several hours.
5. Once the download is complete, you should have an ISO file or a folder with several files in your destination folder. An ISO file is an image of a disc that contains all the files and folders of the software. You can either burn it to a DVD or mount it to a virtual drive using software such as Daemon Tools or PowerISO.
6. Run the setup.exe file from the ISO file or the folder and follow the installation wizard. You may need to enter a serial number or a product key during the installation. You can find these in a text file or a readme file that comes with the torrent. Alternatively, you can use a keygen or a crack to generate or bypass these codes.
7. After the installation is complete, you should have Inventor 2008 x86 x64 installed on your computer. You may need to apply a patch or replace some files with cracked ones to make the software fully functional. You can find these in a crack folder or a separate torrent that comes with the original one.

Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed Inventor 2008 x86 x64 for free using a torrent client. Enjoy your 3D mechanical design and simulation software!
