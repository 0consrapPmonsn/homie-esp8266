However, Mikroc Pro is not free. It requires a license to use all its functionalities. The demo version of Mikroc Pro has a limit of 14 days and 2 kilobytes of code size. This means that you can only use it for a limited time and for small projects.
 
But don't worry, you can still use Mikroc Pro Demo Limit 14 to learn the basics of PIC programming and have some fun. In this article, we will show you how to do that.

## Step 1: Download and Install Mikroc Pro Demo Limit 14
 
The first step is to download and install Mikroc Pro Demo Limit 14 from the official website: [https://www.mikroe.com/mikroc/pic](https://www.mikroe.com/mikroc/pic). You can choose the version that suits your operating system (Windows, Linux or Mac).
 
After downloading the installer, run it and follow the instructions. You will need to accept the terms and conditions and enter your email address to activate the demo version. You will also need to select the installation folder and the components you want to install.
 
Once the installation is complete, you can launch Mikroc Pro from the desktop shortcut or the start menu.
 
## Step 2: Create a New Project
 
The next step is to create a new project in Mikroc Pro. To do that, click on the "New Project" icon on the toolbar or go to File > New Project. A wizard will guide you through the process.
 
You will need to enter a name for your project, choose a location to save it, select a target device (the PIC microcontroller you want to program), and configure some settings such as oscillator frequency, watchdog timer, etc.
 
After creating the project, you will see a blank code editor window where you can write your program. You can also use the project manager window on the left side to add or remove files, libraries, or resources to your project.
 
## Step 3: Write Your Program
 
The third step is to write your program in Mikroc Pro. You can use the built-in code editor to type your code or copy and paste it from another source. You can also use the code assistant window on the right side to access the syntax help, code snippets, or library functions.
 
Mikroc Pro supports several programming languages such as C, BASIC, or Pascal. You can choose the language you prefer from the drop-down menu on the toolbar or go to Project > Project Settings > Language.
 
For this example, we will use C language and write a simple program that blinks an LED connected to pin RB0 of a PIC16F877A microcontroller. Here is the code:

    #include <16F877A.h> // include header file for PIC16F877A
    #device ADC=8 // set ADC resolution to 8 bits
    #use delay(clock=4000000) // set oscillator frequency to 4 MHz
    
    void main() // main function
    
       set_tris_b(0x00); // set port B as output
       while(1) // infinite loop
       
          output_high(PIN_B0); // turn on LED
          delay_ms(500); // wait for 500 milliseconds
          output_low(PIN_B0); // turn off LED
          delay_ms(500); // wait for 500 milliseconds

## Step 4: Compile and Debug Your Program
 
The fourth step is to compile and debug your program in Mikroc Pro. To compile your program, click on the "Build" icon on the toolbar or go to Project > Build. If there are no errors or warnings in your code, you will see a message saying "Build Successful" in the output window at the bottom.
 
To debug your program, you can use the built-in simulator or debugger in Mikroc Pro. The simulator allows you to run your program without
