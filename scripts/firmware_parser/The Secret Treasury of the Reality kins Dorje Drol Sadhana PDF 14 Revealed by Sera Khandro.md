# The Profound Bestowal of Blessings: A SÄdhana of Dorje DrolÃ¶ from the Reality á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ Secret Treasury
 
Dorje DrolÃ¶ is one of the eight manifestations of Guru Padmasambhava, the great master who introduced Buddhism to Tibet in the 8th century. He represents the wrathful aspect of the guru, who subdues the negative forces and obstacles that hinder the spread of the Dharma and the liberation of sentient beings. He is depicted as riding a tiger and holding a vajra and a phurba (ritual dagger) in his hands.
 
The sÄdhana (practice manual) of Dorje DrolÃ¶ presented here is a treasure text (terma) revealed by Sera Khandro (1892-1940), a female visionary and tertÃ¶n (treasure revealer) of the Nyingma tradition. She received this sÄdhana from the reality á¸ÄkinÄ«s, who entrusted her with the secret treasury of their teachings. The sÄdhana is part of a larger collection of texts called ChÃ¶nyi KhandrÃ¶ SangdzÃ¶ (The Secret Treasury of the Reality á¸ÄkinÄ«s), which contains instructions on various aspects of VajrayÄna practice, such as guru yoga, deity yoga, á¸ÄkinÄ« practice, and Dzogchen.

The sÄdhana begins with taking refuge and generating bodhicitta, followed by visualizing the maá¹á¸ala of Dorje DrolÃ¶ and his retinue in the celestial palace. Then, one invokes the wisdom beings and requests their blessings, offers praises and supplications, recites the mantra, performs various activities such as purification, protection, magnetization, and subjugation, and finally dissolves the visualization and rests in the natural state. The sÄdhana concludes with dedicating the merit and making aspirations for the benefit of all beings.
 
The sÄdhana of Dorje DrolÃ¶ is a powerful practice that can help practitioners overcome their inner and outer obstacles, transform their negative emotions into wisdom, and attain realization of the true nature of reality. It is also a practice that can bring peace and harmony to the world by pacifying conflicts, diseases, natural disasters, and other forms of suffering. However, it is not a practice that can be done casually or without proper guidance. One must receive empowerment, transmission, and instructions from a qualified master before engaging in this practice.

The origin of Dorje DrolÃ¶ can be traced back to the life story of Guru Padmasambhava, who was born miraculously from a lotus flower in the land of Oddiyana. He mastered all the teachings and practices of Buddhism and other spiritual traditions, and became known as the second Buddha. He was invited by King Trisong Detsen of Tibet to subdue the negative forces that were obstructing the establishment of Buddhism in the country. He accomplished this by manifesting in various forms according to the needs of different situations and beings.
 
One of these forms was Dorje DrolÃ¶, who appeared when Guru Rinpoche visited Paro Taktsang, a cave in Bhutan that was inhabited by a powerful local deity named Singye Samdrup. Guru Rinpoche subdued him and his entourage by riding on a tigress that was actually his consort YeshÃ© Tsogyal in disguise. He then concealed many treasure teachings (terma) in the cave and other places, entrusting them to his disciples and the oath-bound guardians. He also prophesied that these teachings would be revealed in the future by tertÃ¶ns (treasure revealers) for the benefit of future generations.
 
Dorje DrolÃ¶ is regarded as one of the most wrathful and powerful manifestations of Guru Rinpoche, who embodies the essence of all the buddhas of the three times. He is also associated with crazy wisdom, which is the spontaneous and unconventional expression of enlightened mind that transcends ordinary logic and morality. He is often invoked by practitioners who face great difficulties and dangers, especially in times of degeneration and turmoil. He is also revered as a protector of the terma teachings and a source of blessings for those who practice them.
